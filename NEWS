	o	added URL to DESCRIPTION file.

	o	corrected more problems in bmpt.fia when using small models that
		were related to differences in matrix functionality of Matlab
		and R (the problem is R's default of '[', drop = TRUE).

	o	get.mpt.fia modified such that bmpt.fia is only called as often as
		there are differences in the hank.join parameters (i.e., only if
		the ratio between the trees differ, not the ns). As a consequence,
		CFIA is calculated as part of get.mpt.fia. Furthermore, CIs of CFIA
		are not returned by get.mpt.fia.

	o	fit.mpt adjusted to use the optimization of get.mpt.fia (see above)
		for multi-individual fit. That is, fit.mpt now calls get.mpt.fia
		only once (previous were two calls, one for for individual data,
		one for aggregated data).
	
	o	objective function in fit.mpt vectorized (previous was using
		for-loop). Obtained speed up: ~40%.

	New Features / Bugfixes
	
	o	bmpt.fia fixed to deal with models without restricted parameters
		(was necessary as we did not use en empty matrix correctly)

	o	Corrected a bug that lead to a wrong labeling of restricted
		parameters in the mean parameter table for multi-individual fit
		when using sort.param = TRUE.

	o	Corrected a bug in the R implementation of bmpt.fia, when only one
		parameter was fixed.
