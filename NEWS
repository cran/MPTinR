					**************************
					
					Changes in MPTinR Version 0.8.x
					Released February 2012

	Significant User Visible Changes and new Features
	
	o	fit.mpt and fit.model (see version 0.7.0) are now just wrappers around 
		the new function fit.mptinr. They produce the appropirate objective, gradient,
		hessian, and prediction function to fit the model.
		
	o	fit.model contains an example of how to fit a SDT. see ?fit.model. 
		Dont forget to set lower.bound and upper.bound when fitting non-MPT models.
	
	o	fit.mptinr is a new function that takes an arbitrary objective function and 
		possibly a gradient, hessian and prediction function to fit categorical
		data (see examples in ?fit.model).
	
	o	fitting for MPT and similar models is done using a gradient function,
		which significantly improves fitting speed. In the rare cases where fitting 
		fails using the gradient a numerical gradient is still used (with warning).
		
	o	The Hessian Matrix for MPTs and similar models is now symbolically 
		derived yielding an exact Hessian matrix (before it was numerically estimated 
		leading to incorrect Hessians whean paramaters were exactly at the boundary).
		
	o	fitting is now based on nlminb instead of optim's L-BFGS-B
		(using L-BFGS-B is available in fit.mpt.old)
	
	o	models and restrictions can now be specified using textConnections instead of 
		only external files. See examples in ?fit.mpt and especially ?fit.model. 
		restrictions can be specified as a list of characters.
	
	o	added make.mdt, a function to make .mdt data files which can be read by multiTree 
		or HMMTree.
		
	o	new argument show.messages added to the fitting function (default = TRUE). If 
		FALSE the time messeages around the fitting algorithm are suppressed. 
		
	o	expanded check.mpt functionality (now gives number of categories and 
		number of independent categories)
	
	o	all fitting functions have the argument fit.aggregated to indicate whether or not
		the aggregated data (for multiple datasets) should be fitted. Default is TRUE
	
	o	summary.llks was renamed to fitting.runs
	
	o	model.info now gives the rank of the Fisher Matrix (instead of the rank of the Hessian Matrix).
	
	Bugfixes
	
	o	resolved small bug when fitting using multicore = "individual"
	
	o	no more warning message if CIs cannot be computed.
	
	o	select.mpt now compares aggregated FIA for output = "full"
	
	o	select.mpt now rounds information criteria before determining number of 
		best fits
	
	o	no more warnings by cell counts below 5 (seems unprincipled)
		
	o	fixed bug when resttricted parameters were not in the original model
		(now throws a warning, thanks to Alex)

					** MPTinR VERSION 0.7.0 **
					**************************
					
					Changes in MPTinR Version 0.7.0
					Released January 2012

	Significant User Visible Changes
	
	o	now contains fit.model() a copy of fit.mpt() with arguments for lower and upper bounds
		for the parameters. You should be able to fit a lot more models with this function.
		(fit.model() is slightly slower than fit.mpt() for MPTs)
	
	New Features / Bugfixes
	
	o	MPTinR should now allow easy model files with all types of operators (not only + - *) 
		and even R functions (e.g., pnorm, ...) via the function fit.model()

	o 
	
	New Features / Bugfixes
	
	o	added a parameter to specify the starting values for the fitting routine (in fit.mpt)

	Significant User Visible Changes
	
	o 
	
	New Features / Bugfixes
	
	o	added URL to DESCRIPTION file.

	o	corrected more problems in bmpt.fia when using small models that
		were related to differences in matrix functionality of Matlab
		and R (the problem is R's default of '[', drop = TRUE).

					** MPTinR VERSION 0.6.3 **
					**************************
					
					Changes in MPTinR Version 0.6.3
					Released April 2011

	Significant User Visible Changes
	
	o	get.mpt.fia modified such that bmpt.fia is only called as often as
		there are differences in the hank.join parameters (i.e., only if
		the ratio between the trees differ, not the ns). As a consequence,
		CFIA is calculated as part of get.mpt.fia. Furthermore, CIs of CFIA
		are not returned by get.mpt.fia.

	o	fit.mpt adjusted to use the optimization of get.mpt.fia (see above)
		for multi-individual fit. That is, fit.mpt now calls get.mpt.fia
		only once (previous were two calls, one for for individual data,
		one for aggregated data).
	
	o	objective function in fit.mpt vectorized (previous was using
		for-loop). Obtained speed up: ~40%.

	New Features / Bugfixes
	
	o	bmpt.fia fixed to deal with models without restricted parameters
		(was necessary as we did not use en empty matrix correctly)

	o	Corrected a bug that lead to a wrong labeling of restricted
		parameters in the mean parameter table for multi-individual fit
		when using sort.param = TRUE.

	o	Corrected a bug in the R implementation of bmpt.fia, when only one
		parameter was fixed.
