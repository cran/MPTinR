		* copy editing on documentation.
		* select.mpt(): renamed n.model.df to n.independent.categories

2012-04-16
		* more work on bug when paramaters in restrictions are not in model 
		  (work from yesterday introduced more problems)
		  added function .check.restrictions() which also reads the restrictions
		* added an aggregated example to fit.mpt.Rd

2012-04-14
		* data element now contains indidivudal and aggregated data
		* more work on bug when paramaters in restrictions are not in model 

2012-04-13
		* removed warning when cell counts are < 5
		* restrictions.filename can now be a list of characters
		* worked on examples (textConnections moved in the call to fit.mpt)

2012-03-28
		* fixed bug when restricted parameters were not present in the model

2012-03-19
		* model.info does now return the rank of the Fisher Matrix.
		* summary.llks was renamed to fitting.runs

2012-02-25
		* fitting functions(fit.mptinr, fit.mpt, fit.model) contain the option to not
		  fit the aggregated data for multiple datasets.

2012-02-22
		* check.mpt now also displays number of categories and number of df for the model.
		
		* MPTinR-package.Rd updated to current version number and more functions.

2012-02-07
		* select.mpt now rounds information criteria before determining number of 
		 best fits (also added this to select.mpt.Rd)

2012-02-06
		* resolved small bug for select.mpt (wouldn't show aggregated FIA results
		when output = "full")
		
		* added show.messages parameter to fit.model, fit.mptinr and fit.mpt
		(including their documentation)
		
		* refitting for failed nlminb now uses multicore.

2012-02-04
		* small changes in Rd files for fit.model and fit.mptinr

2012-01-31
		* resolved small bug when fitting using mutlicore = "individual" 
		
		* changed Description
		
		* changed warning messages when optimization did not converge successfully.

2012-01-30
		* resolved small bug in calculating the FIA (moved routine to calculate 
		  the FIA to the wrapper functions fit.mpt and fit.model, changed argument
		  fia to fia.df in fit.mptinr). Changed fit.mptinr.Rd accordingly.
		
		* reading models should now work with connections (changed .get.mpt.model so that
		   connections are always read as "easy").
		
		* added function make.dt with help page (in make.eqn,.Rd)
		
		* added examples in fit.mptinr and fit.model
		
		* changed default starting values to c(0.1, 0.9).


2012-01-27
		* first release of MPTinR 0.8.x. changed fit.mpt and fit.model to be wrappers 
		  around fit.mptinr, which now uses nlminb.
		* fit.mpt.old is the old version of fit.mpt using otpim.
		* changed the rd files accordingly to reflect the changes above.

2012-01-18
		* fixed but in fit.model()'s lower and upper.bound arguments. Now works

2012-01-12
		* changed .find.mpt.params to rely on all.vars()
		* adapted fit.mpt() (creating parameters from inequality restrictions) to 
		  deal with the new .find.mpt.params() function (i.e., inequalities are 
		  parse()d prior to calling .find.mpt.params).
		* added fit.model(), a copy of fit.mpt() with parameter bounds as an argument

2011-06-30

		* R/fit.mpt.R: now starting value parameter works
		* Small bug removed when fitting one row from a data.frame (now, does not set multiFit to TRUE)

2011-06-29

		* R/fit.mpt.R: fixed crashing when hessian of aggregated data was ill defined

2011-06-28

		* R/fit.mpt.R: added starting.values parameter.
		* R/fit.mpt.Rd: added description for the starting.values parameter.
		* R/fit.mpt.R: internal changes: replaced length.tree with n.params.

2011-06-14

		* R/bmpt.fia.R: if theta is a scalar, it now is a matrix.
